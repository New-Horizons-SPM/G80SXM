# G80SXM
G80SXM is a tool written in python to quickly analyse and create figures for Nanonis SPM data (STM/STS/nc-AFM).
I am actively developing this tool so if you have any suggestions or find any bugs, feel free to create an issue

# Installation
clone the repository and run 'pip install .' from the root directory

To run: python gui.py

# Usage
There are a number of panels in the gui, each with a specific function. See below figures for some examples. Hovering over buttons in the GUI will also provide help
